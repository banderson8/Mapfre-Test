# Mapfre-Test
Test given by Mapfre to create a program and a Database

PROGRAM PART:

With this program I have created, the user is prompted to enter 1 or 2 as asked.
Entering 1 will ask the user for an input of type int and will then add the number to the Queue.
It will ask the user if they would like to add another number or dequeue a number from the Queue.
If you enter 2, it will take out a number from the Queue based on FIFO rules.
If there is nothing in the Queue and you try to remove a number from the Queue,
The program will tell you to add a number to the Queue because the Queue is empty.
If the Queue reaches the limit of 10 values in the Queue,
The program will tell the user that the Queue is full and they need to Dequeue values to add more.
I also added another option, by entering 3 you can break the Queue and it will tell you your final Queue.

To run the program, you just go to the run option in your IDE and click on main.
It should then take you to the console where you will be prompted to enter the numbers mentioned above.

DATABASE PART:

With this database, you're going to want to open it in SQL lite, which is what I used to create this database.
Once you open it up, you will see the structure of the Database which I setup with the three different entities. 
These entities are: Product Information, Inventory, and Customer.
Each have their own attributes and effect each other in different ways.
For example, PName in Product Information is a Primary Key for PName in Inventory so you don't have to retype it.
You can see the DDL's of the database by going to the DDL tab in each of the three different entities. 
If you run those DDL's, they should make that table that I created.
I also added data to the each of the entites and you can see that if you go to the data tab of each of the entities.
I also attached an ER diagram via Jpeg that I drew up on notebook paper.

Thank you for this wonderful oppurtunity!
