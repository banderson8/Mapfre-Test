# Mapfre-Test
Test given by Mapfre to create a program and a Database

With this program I have created, the user is prompted to enter 1 or 2 as asked.
Entering 1 will ask the user for an input of type int and will then add the number to the Queue
It will ask the user if they would like to add another number or dequeue a number from the Queue
If you enter 2, it will take out a number from the Queue based on FIFO rules
If there is nothing in the Queue and you try to remove a number from the Queue,
The program will tell you to add a number to the Queue because the Queue is empty
If the Queue reaches the limit of 10 values in the Queue,
The program will tell the user that the Queue is full and they need to Dequeue values to add more
I also added another option, by entering 3 you can break the Queue and it will tell you your final Queue

To run the program, you just go to the run option in your IDE and click on main
It should then take you to the console where you will be prompted to enter the numbers mentioned above 

Thank you for this wonderful oppurtunity!
